His vision was to develop a mobile application that could blend elements from GoodReads, Spotify, and Instagram, such that users would be able to read, share, and find books in a social media setting. I had a conversation with Daee to gain a better understanding of his visions, goals, and motivations for this project. After talking to Daee, I found that the goal he had for Readit was driven by how often his friends would exchange book recommendations, without being able to conglomerate all recommendations efficiently, and in one place.

Through research, I found that although users default to using GoodReads due to the application's established popularity, users were unsatisifed with how complicated it was to find friends, find books, and add books to the shelf. Users wanted a sleek, straightforward, and efficient experience when completing these tasks. Users revealed that they typically have seamless experience when navigating their favorite social media or music streaming applications. With this information in mind, I was able to analyze the problem with exisitng applications, and define a new method of approaching the solution to these problems.
